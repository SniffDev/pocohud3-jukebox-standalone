# PocoHud3 Jukebox Standalone
**A standalone version of [PocoHud3](https://modworkshop.net/mod/40870)'s jukebox (music select) feature**

I always liked the PocoHud menu style and hated the look of the other existing jukebox mod, [Music JukeBox Control](https://modworkshop.net/mod/24765) by easternunit100. So I cleaned everything else from Poco except the jukebox, and now I have the best from both worlds!

### Features
(Everything is already available in the full PocoHud3)

- Change music tracks mid-heist (menu tracks are available too!)
- Play assault phase-specific segments from tracks (stealth, control, anticipation, assault)
- Accessible via a keybind (BACKSPACE by default)
- "Now Playing" toggleable pop-up at the top left of the game (text is customizable)
- Doesn't need updating when new tracks are released
- Around 1/10th of PocoHud3's size! <sub>*(Wasn't everything available in the full HUD?)*</sub>

No music shuffle because I never got it to work for some reason. In the meantime, [Use Music Control](https://modworkshop.net/mod/20833) for playing randomized tracks, it also includes music playlists.
